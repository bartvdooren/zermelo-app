Zermelo App - Open Source Edition
=================================

The Zermelo App allows students, teachers and parents to view schedules and announcements from their Zermelo Portal.
The goal is to make information from the Zermelo Portal/API easily accessible on mobile phones. Tablet support is not a 
high priority as tablets are expected access the Zermelo Portal directly.

Please note that Zermelo and the Zermelo logo are trademarks of Zermelo Software B.V. You are not allowed to claim that your version of the app is in any way the official one. Note that this does not constitute an extra
license term for the MIT license below, it's just a part of trademark law. This is also why we've made this version of the app blue.
You can compare this to the Chromium project that is released by Google as the Chrome browser.

Improvements to the Open Source Edition of the Zermelo app will be published to the app stores as the official Zermelo App.
The only modifications on our side are to change the color to "Zermelo red".
The Zermelo App has about 100.000 installs right now. If you want to share your improvements with all these people please submit a pull request.
If you find bugs, feel free to add issues on Github.

For documentation on how to use the Zermelo API please take a look at http://developers.zermelo.nl

Building
========

The App currently supports Android and iOS. Windows support should not be too hard to add, the main problem is that WebSQL is not supported
on Windows Phone.

Building using Adobe PhoneGap
--------

The easiest way to build the app both for Android and iOS is using [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com). You should create an account
and add signing keys for the platforms you are interested in. Then you can ZIP the contents of the "www" directory (without actually having
"www" as a subdirectory). You can then upload this ZIP file to PhoneGap build to build the app.

Building using Apache Cordova
-----------------------------

You can also use Apache Cordova to build the app:

````bash
zermelo-app$ cordova platform add android

zermelo-app$ cordova build
````

Architecture
============

The app is based on Sencha Touch. The starting point for the app is www/index.html. Then www/app.js is loaded, and this shows the www/app/view/Main.js view.
This view checks if the app has been linked to the portal, and if not it shows the www/app/view/Login.js view. Otherwise it shows the
www/app/view/Home.js view. The Home view is the main application, and contains the menu bar and the other views.

The www/js folder contains some supporting libraries. www/js/database.js takes care of storing all appointment and announcement data.
www/js/fullcalendar.js renders the calendar view.

Note that the app was not in any way "cleaned up" before being made open source. You will undoubtly find quite a bit of unused files and unused code.
Code quality is also not guaranteed.

License - Components
====================

The app uses various (open source) libraries. The main one is Sencha Touch. Sencha Touch is included in this repository under the GPLv3
license. Note that the Apple and Microsoft app stores do not allow the GPLv3. A solution for this is to use the commercial license for
Sencha Touch. Sencha Touch is available under the commercial license for free from the Sencha Touch website.

Licenses for other components can be found in the respective directories and files.
